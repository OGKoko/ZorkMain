commands to play Zork below:
<N> to go North			<L> to list the items
<S> to go South			<G> to take the items
<W> to go West 			<I> to list the Inventory
<E> to go East 			<D> to Drop any item from the Inventory
<H> to get commands list ingame

you can write the full name of the inputs and can be uppercase or lowercase, 
whatever you feel more comfortable with.

there are a couple mechanics that involve items that are on the different rooms, such as:

if you grab nails, they will hurt you, the items will be destroyed and player will have -1hp (if ran out of hp, its game over);
if you grab the bandages 2 things could happend, if you're hurted it will automatically add 1hp to your current lifepoints,
if your hp are maxed(3 hp is the cap), Bandages will be stored on your inventory, you will need to drop them to get healed if got hurted;

To finish the game you need to take the key that is placed in Main gardent (the path to go is [North, South, South]), grab the Vault Key
go to the Backyard, wich is the next room on the south, if you got the previous key on the inventory and your try to <G>et the Vault, it
will open and give you a key wich will be on your inventory, after that you need to go to the Main Garden again, wich is located on <N>orth
and then go, <E>ast.

if you had the Door Key on your inventory you'll be able to complete the game.
